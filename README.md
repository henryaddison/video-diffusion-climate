From GH:

> video_diffusion_pytorch.py [video_diffusion_pytorch.py] contains pretty much all of the relevant code, including the 3D U-Net, code for the diffusion model, code for the trainer class, etc. etc.
>
> train.py [train.py] is just a little script that configures the 3D U-Net, diffusion model and trainer class a little before actually running the training process
